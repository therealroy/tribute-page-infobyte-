        Steve Jobs is the authorized self-titled biography of American business
        magnate and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. The book was written at the
        request of Jobs by Walter Isaacson, a former executive at CNN and Time
        who had previously written best-selling biographies of Benjamin Franklin
        and Albert Einstein. Based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs
        conducted over two years—in addition to interviews with more than 100
        family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and
        colleagues—Isaacson was given "unprecedented" access to Jobs's life.
        Jobs is said to have encouraged the people interviewed to speak
        honestly. Although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no
        control over its content other than the book's cover, and waived the
        right to read it before it was published. Describing his writing,
        Isaacson commented that he had striven to take a balanced view of his
        subject that did not sugarcoat Jobs's flaws.The book was released on
        October 24, 2011, by Simon & Schuster in the United States, 19 days
        after Jobs's death.
